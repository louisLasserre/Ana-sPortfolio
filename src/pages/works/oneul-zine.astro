The goal of this issue was to allow people to be spontaneous and capture the present moment.<br><br> I designed a few spreads exposed above.<br><br> Ranging from interviews to editorial photoshoots and designs, we were able to do a mini-issue that we’re proud of.";

In order to grow the community, I decided to go for aesthetically pleasing visuals and videos (reels & tiktoks). We also collaborated with other creators to gain some visibility on different but interesting niches. In a year, we gained more than 3K followers.  ";
