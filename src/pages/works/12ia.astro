    Their style is edgy and unapologetically raw.<br /> Working with them has allowed
    me to go for a darker theme and palette when coming up with their brand strategy.<br

    Below is the brand strategy we came up with to elevate 12IA. Keeping darker colors
    while going for a more modern style.`;
