Its goal is to facilitate their daily life by listing all relevant services (including associations, social economy entities, institutions, companies) tailored to their needs like food, housing, and administrative tasks through 30-second videos.",

    "This project addresses a crucial need for social inclusion, as access to information and services is often challenging for newcomers, potentially leading to social isolation and exclusion. The videos are created by the newcomers themselves, aiming to share their life stories and highlight the various services that have helped them. ",
